Let's see how far we will come with the Advent of Code[^aoc] challenges in Kotlin.


This repo is based on the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.


[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
